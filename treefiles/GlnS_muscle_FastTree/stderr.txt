ML-NNI round 1: LogLk = -676.026 NNIs 0 max delta 0.00 Time 0.01
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.650 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods

Turning off heuristics for final round of ML NNIs (converged)
